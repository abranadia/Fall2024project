# Python Calculator Web Application

This project is a web-based calculator that performs statistical calculations using Flask. It includes various operations like computing mean, standard deviation, z-score, regression formula, and more.

## Features

- **Compute Mean**: Calculate the average of a list of numbers.
- **Compute Sample Standard Deviation**: Compute sample standard deviation.
- **Compute Population Standard Deviation**: Compute population standard deviation.
- **Compute Z Score**: Calculate z-score for a given value, mean, and standard deviation.
- **Compute Regression Formula**: Calculate the linear regression formula (y = mx + b) from x,y pairs.
- **Predict Y**: Predict y value using the regression formula.
